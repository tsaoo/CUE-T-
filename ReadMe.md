✅CUE-T✅

Dane Tsao

Name - (Check Until Etheruem Two(2.0))
If you are reading this, you most likely have interacted with the Ethereum Blockchain. If so, you know that because the network is so popular, there are subjectively expensive gas fees needed to record a transaction or execute a smart contract to the blockchain. So, until Ethereum 2.0, the implementation of new technology(the merge or shard chains), or some other solution comes, you will need to use a gas price checker to facilate and prepare your gas spendings.
Introducing CUE-T!

**Note**

Unfortunately, I was unable to fully complete this project to its requirements and develop all of the endpoints. My lack of experience with REST and JSON forced me to look at documentation often. Regardless of the outcome, thank you for the oppurtunity to explore Etherscans API and improve my skills!

I. Decisions

- REST vs Websocket

- Language

I chose to write in node.js for many reasons. I wasn't the most familiar with any of the preferred languages but ended up going with node.js.

I considered python as I am more profienct in this, but ultimately deceided against this to challenge myself and it is less popular for writing web servers.

- Database

My choice of database was MongoDB. This was a clear pick because I am most familiar with MongoDB. The reason I chose MongoDB as the database to explore initially was because of its flexibility and versatility. In addition, MongoDB is very popular and I found finding material to help troubleshoot plentiful.

- API

My decision between Etherscan and EthGasStation was much simpler. I am completely unfamiliar with EthGasStation and had never heard of it prior to this project. I am much more familiar with Etherscan as this is more common to me when confirming my block transactions. This combined with the concrete rate limit made Etherscan the clear winner.


II. What I woul Do Differently if I Could do this Project Again

If I were able to redo this project I would have prioritzed planning. In addition, I would hope for my general knowledge to be more advanced and to put a big emphasis on sudo coding th problem. But, just as I did this time, I would come into the project open mineded and give it my best shot.

III. Problems I Faced and Attempted Solutions

Creating the objects to store information in MongoDB - This was challenging to understnad how to have my code interact with Etherscans API and send info to the DB. I ended up learning how to properly deifine an object to begin and worked my way up from there.

Working with the endpoints assigned - This was tough for me intially. I was having trouble transmitting my information to each individual endpoint most likely to the poor initial structure. I think I needed to make a controller or some type of additional backend piece.

Dockerizing the project -  this was not as big of a concern because I didnt have a complete project to dockerize, however I think watching Docker tutorials and attempting this as my first step would have been effective.


IV. Closings

Although challenging, this project allowed me to gauge my skills and my speed. I enjoyed doing this becuase it allowed me to combine my passion for computer science and one of my greatest interests in cryptocurrency. it also allowed me to interact with an API of a company that I am familiar with.

- Near Future

I am going to revisit this and hopefully sucesffuly meet all of the requirements and gain the knowledge and tools to replicate this. I plan to add a frontend to this project and upload it to Git as not only is this in my field of interest, but it will(and already has) help me sharpen and develop my skills. Again, thank you for the oppurtunity and I appreciate you taking time to consider.# CUE-T-
